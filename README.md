# thoenluk-exercism-java

This repository serves as VCS and publication method for my solutions to Exercism's java track exercises. Exercise descriptions are not provided by default, as I feel that would violate the point of Exercism (which is a progressive, feedback-based elevation of challenge.) However, if you are interested in a particular solution I made, feel free to contact me to discuss the exercise posted and the solution in general. All finished solutions pass the tests provided alongside the exercise in full. Main exercises were approved by mentors, as they must be to progress.
